Implement access control on a directory of files. Create two C functions, myread and mywrite, that
call the read and write functions, respectively, but only after verifying that the user has permission
to access the requested file in the requested manner. You can find the user id of the current process by
calling getuid. Your access control mechanism will be separate from that provided by the operating
system; your functions should search a file containing access control lists for each file in the directory.
(You will create this file and determine its format.)
